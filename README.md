## Chat app for cool people

To get started: 
   From the root folder run the command ```npm run start``` which will run your frontend server
   In another terminal change directories into `backend`
   Run command ```node src/app.js``` which will run your backend server

Enter ```localhost:3000``` in your google chrome browser, choose a room and then chat away!

I spent about 12 hours on this project. You can join a room and send chats. There are some issues with setting up the user and local storage.
